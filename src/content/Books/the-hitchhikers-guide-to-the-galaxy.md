title: The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy
---

Sequel: [[the-restaurant-at-the-end-of-the-universe|The Restaurant At The End Of The Universe by Douglas Adams]]

I'd like to add some notes about this book, because it particularly changed the way I see the world. I was in 8th grade when I first read this series and I constantly think about how clever and funny and brilliant this series is. It's a huge part of who I am.

> [!faq] Reflections on life's journeys  
> Bypasses are devices which allow some people to dash from point A to point B very fast whilst other people dash from point B to point A very fast. People living at point C, being a point directly in between, are often given to wonder what’s so great about point A that so many people from point B are so keen to get there, and what’s so great about point B that so many people from point A are so keen to get there. They often wish that people would just once and for all work out where the hell they want to be.
> Mr Prosser wanted to be at point D. Point D wasn’t anywhere in particular, it was just any convenient point a very long way from points A, B and C. He would have a nice little cottage at point D, with axes over the door, and spend a pleasant amount of time at point E, which would be the nearest pub to point D.

> [!note] The relief of familiarity  
> As soon as Mr Prosser realized that he was substantially the loser after all, it was as if a weight lifted itself off his shoulders: this was more like the world as he knew it

---

> [!bug] Timing trustworthiness  
> ‘But can we trust him?’ he said.
> ‘Myself, I’d trust him to the end of the Earth,’ said Ford.
> ‘Oh yes,’ said Arthur, ‘and how far’s that?’
> ‘About twelve minutes away,’ said Ford.

> [!faq] On alcohol's effects and the "Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster"  
> Here’s what The Encyclopaedia Galactica has to say about alcohol. It says that alcohol is a colourless volatile liquid formed by the fermentation of sugars and also notes its intoxicating effect on certain carbon-based life forms.
> The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy also mentions alcohol. It says that the best drink in existence is the Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster.
> It says that the effect of drinking a Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster is **like having your brains smashed out by a slice of lemon wrapped round a large gold brick.**
> The Guide also tells you on which planets **the best Pan Galactic Gargle Blasters are mixed, how much you can expect to pay for one and what voluntary organizations exist to help you rehabilitate afterwards.**
> The Guide even tells you how you can mix one yourself.
> Take the juice from one bottle of that Ol’ Janx Spirit, it says.
> Pour into it one measure of water from the seas of Santraginus V – Oh, that Santraginean sea water, it says. Oh, those Santraginean fish!!!
> Allow three cubes of Arcturan Mega-gin to melt into the mixture (it must be properly iced or the benzine is lost).
> Allow four litres of Fallian marsh gas to bubble through it, in memory of all those **happy Hikers who have died of pleasure in the Marshes of Fallia**.
> Over the back of a silver spoon float a measure of Qualactin Hypermint extract, redolent of all the heady odours of the dark Qualactin Zones, subtle, sweet and mystic.
> Drop in the tooth of an Algolian Suntiger. Watch it dissolve, spreading the fires of the Algolian Suns deep into the heart of the drink.
> Sprinkle Zamphuor.
> Add an olive.
> **Drink . . . but . . . very carefully . . .**
> The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy sells rather better than The Encyclopaedia Galactica.

> [!note] The mysterious value of a towel  
> a towel has immense psychological value. For some reason, if a strag (strag: non-hitchhiker) discovers that a hitchhiker has his towel with him, he will automatically assume that he is also in possession of a toothbrush, face flannel, soap, tin of biscuits, flask, compass, map, ball of string, gnat spray, wet-weather gear, space suit, etc., etc. Furthermore, the strag will then happily lend the hitchhiker any of these or a dozen other items that the hitchhiker might accidentally have ‘lost’. What the strag will think is that **any man who can hitch the length and breadth of the Galaxy, rough it, slum it, struggle against terrible odds, win through, and still know where his towel is is clearly a man to be reckoned with.**

> [!bug] Existential worry  
> The pub was silent for a moment longer and then, embarrassingly enough, the man with the raucous laugh did it again. The girl he had dragged along to the pub with him had grown to loathe him dearly over the last hour, and it would probably have been a great satisfaction to her to know that in a minute and a half or so he would suddenly evaporate into a whiff of hydrogen, ozone and carbon monoxide. However, **when the moment came she would be too busy evaporating herself to notice it.**

---

> [!faq] The real role of the Galactic President  
> Only six people in the Galaxy knew that **the job of the Galactic President was not to wield power but to attract attention away from it.**
> Zaphod Beeblebrox was amazingly good at his job.

---

> [!bug] Common sense at a military academy  
> How do you feel?’ he asked him.
> ‘Like a military academy,’ said Arthur, **‘bits of me keep on passing out.’**

---

> [!bug] On the peculiarities of “safe”  
> ‘We’re safe,’ he said.
> ‘Oh good,’ said Arthur.
> ‘We’re in a small galley cabin,’ said Ford, ‘in one of the spaceships of the Vogon Constructor Fleet.’
> ‘Ah,’ said Arthur, **‘this is obviously some strange usage of the word safe that I wasn’t previously aware of.’**

---

> [!faq] The improbability of Babel fish and faith  
> if you stick a Babel fish in your ear you can instantly understand anything said to you in any form of language. The speech patterns you actually hear decode the brainwave matrix which has been fed into your mind by your Babel fish.
> ‘Now it is such a bizarrely improbable coincidence that anything so mind-bogglingly useful could have evolved purely by chance that some thinkers have chosen to see it as a final and clinching proof of the non-existence of God.
> ‘The argument goes something like this: “I refuse to prove that I exist,” says God, “for proof denies faith, and without faith I am nothing.”
> ‘“But,” says Man, “the Babel fish is a dead giveaway, isn’t it? It could not have evolved by chance. It proves you exist, and so therefore, by your own arguments, you don’t. QED.”
> ‘**“Oh dear,” says God, “I hadn’t thought of that,” and promptly vanishes in a puff of logic.**
> **‘“Oh, that was easy,” says Man, and for an encore goes on to prove that black is white and gets himself killed on the next zebra crossing**

---

> [!bug] Misunderstood dolphin messages  
> The dolphins had long known of the impending destruction of the planet Earth and had made many attempts to alert mankind to the danger; but most of their communications were misinterpreted as amusing attempts to punch footballs or whistle for titbits, so they eventually gave up and left the Earth by their own means shortly before the Vogons arrived.
> The last ever dolphin message was misinterpreted as a surprisingly sophisticated attempt to do a double-backwards somersault through a hoop whilst whistling the ‘Star Spangled Banner’, but in fact the message was this: **So long, and thanks for all the fish.**

---

> [!faq] The expansive yet deceiving nature of infinity  
> The car shot forward straight into the circle of light, and suddenly Arthur had a fairly clear idea of what infinity looked like.
> It wasn’t infinity, in fact. Infinity itself looks flat and uninteresting. Looking up into the night sky is looking into infinity – distance is incomprehensible and therefore meaningless. The chamber into which the aircar emerged was anything but infinite, it was just very very very big, so big that it gave the impression of infinity far better than infinity itself.

---

> [!bug] The "hyper-intelligent" game of Brockian Ultra-Cricket  
> Many many millions of years ago a race of hyper-intelligent pan-dimensional beings (whose physical manifestation in their own pan-dimensional universe is not dissimilar to our own) got so fed up with the constant bickering about the meaning of life which used to interrupt their favourite pastime of Brockian Ultra-Cricket (**a curious game which involved suddenly hitting people for no readily apparent reason and then running away**)

---

> [!faq] A computer too clever for its own good  
> And to this end they built themselves a stupendous supercomputer which was so amazingly intelligent that even before its data banks had been connected up it had started from I think therefore I am **and got as far as deducing the existence of rice pudding and income tax before anyone managed to turn it off**

---

> [!bug] A life-threatening misunderstanding of scale  
> It is of course well known that careless talk costs lives, but the full scale of the problem is not always appreciated.
> For instance, at the very moment that Arthur said, ‘I seem to be having tremendous difficulty with my lifestyle,’ a freak wormhole opened up in the fabric of the space–time continuum and carried his words far far back in time across almost infinite reaches of space to a distant galaxy where strange and warlike beings were poised on the brink of frightful interstellar battle.
> The two opposing leaders were meeting for the last time.
> A dreadful silence fell across the conference table as the commander of the Vl’hurgs, resplendent in his black jewelled battle shorts, gazed levelly at the G’Gugvuntt leader squatting opposite him in a cloud of green sweet-smelling steam, and, with a million sleek and horribly beweaponed star cruisers poised to unleash electric death at his single word of command, challenged the vile creature to take back what it had said about his mother.
> The creature stirred in his sickly broiling vapour, and at that very moment the words I seem to be having tremendous difficulty with my lifestyle drifted across the conference table.
> Unfortunately, in the Vl’hurg tongue this was the most dreadful insult imaginable, and there was nothing for it but to wage terrible war for centuries.
> Eventually of course, after their galaxy had been decimated over a few thousand years, it was realized that the whole thing had been a ghastly mistake, and so the two opposing battle fleets settled their few remaining differences in order to launch a joint attack on our own galaxy – now positively identified as the source of the offending remark.
> For thousands more years the mighty ships tore across the empty wastes of space and finally dived screaming onto the first planet they came across – which happened to be the Earth – where due to a terrible miscalculation of scale the entire battle fleet was accidentally swallowed by a small dog.
> **Those who study the complex interplay of cause and effect in the history of the Universe say that this sort of thing is going on all the time, but that we are powerless to prevent it**.
> ‘It’s just life,’ they say.
