Here's a directory of websites I like. There's no rhyme or reason to their order but check them out.

1. [antonymph](https://lyra.horse/antonymph/) - I think it's best if you just click this to find out... I'd rather not spoil the absolute chaos that is this website.
2. [Internet Movie Car Database](https://www.imcdb.org/) - A database of cars, vehicles, bikes and trucks as seen in movies and TV Shows. It's a cool thing to click around on.
3. [Hard Drive](https://hard-drive.net/) - Incredibly good satire page that I really enjoy reading. It's like the Onion but for a different niche.
4. [One Tiny Hand](https://onetinyhand.com/) - Website of tiny hands.
5. [Food Timeline](https://foodtimeline.org/) - The Food Timeline is exactly what it sounds like.
