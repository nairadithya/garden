title: Welcome To My Garden
---
This is my online personal knowledge garden.

To those unfamiliar with the concept, it's the home of all my thoughts both incubating and mature.

This place will act as a home to all the things that have informed me. As well as the things I like to keep around.

All writings beautiful, thoughtful and inspirational will find a home here. All ideas that fit that same bill will also find their home here.

# Start Here

## Books

[[Books]], they're a nice mix of fiction and non-fiction. Anything I find beautiful or inspiring will show up. Have a read through my highlights for [[the-name-of-the-wind|The Name Of The Wind]] or [[babel|Babel]]. I find them quite nice to browse through. If you're looking for some entertainment, might I interest you in the work of [[the-hitchhikers-guide-to-the-galaxy|Douglas Adams]]? Maybe they might convince you to pick up the actual books themselves?
